# Episodes Page Protection Implementation

## üìã Overview

The `/episodes` page now has authentication protection that redirects non-signed-in visitors immediately to the homepage. This follows the same clean pattern as the `/account` page.

## ‚úÖ What Was Done

### 1. Created New Script: `episodes-page.js`

**Location:** `/public/js/episodes-page.js`

**Functionality:**
- Waits for authentication system to initialize
- Checks if user is signed in using `window.timBurtonAuth.isSignedIn()`
- If NOT signed in ‚Üí Immediate redirect to homepage (`/`)
- If signed in ‚Üí Allows access to episodes page

**Pattern:** Identical to `account-page.js` for consistency

### 2. Updated Documentation

**WEBFLOW_INTEGRATION.md:**
- Added new section **"15. Episodes Page Protection"** (lines 1866-1920)
- Updated scripts section to include `episodes-page.js` (lines 111-112)
- Provided clear instructions on how to add the script to Webflow
- Added testing instructions

**public/README.md:**
- Updated file structure to include all JavaScript files with descriptions
- Shows `episodes-page.js` in the file tree

## üîß Implementation Details

### Code Pattern (Consistent with Account Page)

```javascript
class EpisodesPageManager {
  constructor() {
    this.init();
  }
  
  async init() {
    // Wait for auth to initialize
    if (!window.timBurtonAuth) {
      await this.waitForAuth();
    }
    
    // Check if user is signed in
    if (!window.timBurtonAuth.isSignedIn()) {
      this.redirectToHomepage();
      return;
    }
    
    // User is authenticated, allow access
    console.log('‚úÖ User authenticated, episodes page access granted');
  }
  
  redirectToHomepage() {
    window.location.href = '/';
  }
}
```

### Key Principles Followed

‚úÖ **No band-aid solutions** - Clean, purpose-built script  
‚úÖ **No patchwork code** - Follows existing patterns exactly  
‚úÖ **Consistent with authentication flow** - Uses same auth checks  
‚úÖ **Elegant integration** - Seamless with existing codebase  
‚úÖ **Simple and maintainable** - Easy to understand and modify

## üìù How to Deploy

### Step 1: Deploy Script to Cloudflare Pages

The `episodes-page.js` file is in `/public/js/` and will be automatically deployed with your next Cloudflare Pages deployment.

**URL:** `https://tim-burton-docuseries.pages.dev/js/episodes-page.js`

### Step 2: Add Script to Webflow Episodes Page

1. Go to Webflow
2. Navigate to the **Episodes page** (`/episodes`)
3. Open **Page Settings ‚Üí Custom Code**
4. In **Before `</body>` tag**, add:

```html
<script src="https://tim-burton-docuseries.pages.dev/js/episodes-page.js"></script>
```

5. Publish your site

### Step 3: Test

**Test 1: Redirect when not signed in**
1. Sign out (or use incognito mode)
2. Try to visit `/episodes` directly
3. ‚úÖ Should redirect to homepage immediately

**Test 2: Access when signed in**
1. Sign in to your account
2. Visit `/episodes`
3. ‚úÖ Should load normally and show episodes content

**Test 3: Direct URL access**
1. While signed out, paste `/episodes` URL in browser
2. ‚úÖ Should redirect to homepage

## üéØ Benefits

1. **Security:** Prevents unauthorized access to episodes page
2. **Consistency:** Same pattern as account page
3. **User Experience:** Immediate redirect (no loading or waiting)
4. **Maintainability:** Clean, simple code that follows existing patterns
5. **Scalability:** Easy to add similar protection to other pages

## üîÑ Relationship with Other Components

### Uses:
- `window.timBurtonAuth` - Core authentication system
- `window.timBurtonAuth.isSignedIn()` - Authentication check
- `window.timBurtonAuth.isInitialized` - Initialization check

### Similar To:
- `account-page.js` - Same protection pattern
- `password-reset-page.js` - Page-specific functionality

### Works With:
- `client-auth.js` - Must load before this script
- `webflow-auth-handlers.js` - Global auth event handling

## üìö Related Documentation

- **Full integration guide:** `WEBFLOW_INTEGRATION.md` (Section 15)
- **Account page pattern:** `WEBFLOW_INTEGRATION.md` (Section 14)
- **Authentication system:** `WEBFLOW_INTEGRATION.md` (Section 2-4)

## ‚ú® Summary

This implementation provides a clean, secure way to protect the episodes page from unauthorized access. It follows the established patterns in your codebase and requires minimal configuration to deploy.

**No patchwork. No band-aids. Just solid, integrated code.** ‚úÖ
