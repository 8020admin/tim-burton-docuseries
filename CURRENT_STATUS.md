## üéØ Recently Completed: SendGrid Email Integration

### Implementation Status
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete and deployed  
**Date Completed:** January 14, 2025

### What's Working
- ‚úÖ Welcome emails on account creation
- ‚úÖ Purchase confirmation emails (rental, regular, box set)
- ‚úÖ Password reset emails
- ‚úÖ Rental expiration warnings (48h and 24h before)
- ‚úÖ Scheduled function running hourly
- ‚úÖ Professional sender name ("Tim Burton Docuseries")
- ‚úÖ Sender email: admin@woodentertainment.net

### Current Issue
‚ö†Ô∏è **Emails may go to spam folder without domain authentication**

### Recommended Action
**Set up domain authentication in SendGrid** (10 minutes + DNS wait)
- Go to: https://app.sendgrid.com/ > Settings > Sender Authentication
- Click "Authenticate Your Domain"
- Add 3 DNS records to woodentertainment.net
- Wait for DNS verification (24-48 hours)
- **Result:** 90%+ of emails will go to inbox instead of spam
