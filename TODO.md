**Last Updated:** January 2025

## üî¥ High Priority

### **1. Set Up Domain Authentication (SendGrid)**
**Status:** Optional but Highly Recommended  
**Effort:** 10 minutes + DNS wait time  
**Reference:** `SENDGRID_GUIDE.md` > Preventing Spam Folder Issues

**Description:**
Emails are working and being delivered, but may go to spam folder without domain authentication. Setting up domain authentication will move 90%+ of emails from spam to inbox.

**Current Status:**
- ‚úÖ SendGrid fully integrated and deployed
- ‚úÖ Emails sending successfully from admin@woodentertainment.net
- ‚úÖ All transactional emails active (welcome, purchases, password reset, rental warnings)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Emails may go to spam without domain authentication

**Setup Domain Authentication:**
1. Go to SendGrid Dashboard: https://app.sendgrid.com/
2. Navigate to Settings > Sender Authentication
3. Click "Authenticate Your Domain"
4. Add 3 DNS records to woodentertainment.net
5. Wait for DNS verification (24-48 hours)

**Result:** Emails will go to inbox instead of spam

**Documentation:** See full guide in `SENDGRID_GUIDE.md`

## üü° Medium Priority

### **1. Add New Product: Box Set Upgrade (Discounted Price)**
**Status:** Pending  
**Effort:** 2-3 hours  
**Reference:** `PRODUCT_MANAGEMENT_GUIDE.md`

**Description:**
Create an upgrade path for users who purchased the Regular edition to upgrade to Box Set at a discounted price ($49.99 instead of $74.99).

**Implementation Plan:**
1. **Create new Price in Stripe** for Box Set product:
   - Regular Price: $74.99 (existing)
   - Upgrade Price: $49.99 (new)
   
2. **Update Backend** (`src/backend/functions/src/stripe.ts`):
   - Add `upgrade` price ID to Box Set product
   - Create `getBoxSetPrice(userId)` function to check purchase history
   - Return upgrade price if user owns Regular edition
   
3. **Update Frontend** (purchase modal/page):
   - Display upgrade price for eligible users
   - Show "Save $25!" messaging
   - Update button text to "Upgrade to Box Set"

**Files to Update:**
- `src/backend/functions/src/stripe.ts`
- `public/js/stripe-integration.js` (or create new pricing display)
- `scripts/setup-stripe-products.js` (optional - to document new price)

**Testing:**
- Purchase Regular edition
- Verify Box Set shows discounted price
- Complete upgrade purchase
- Verify access to all content

### **2. Consider Initials Avatar for Email/Password Users**
**Status:** Optional/Nice-to-have  
**Effort:** 15-20 minutes  

**Description:**
Users who sign up with email/password don't have profile pictures. We can generate initials-based avatars using a free service.

**Implementation:**
Add fallback to `account-page.js`:
```javascript
generateInitialsAvatar(firstName, lastName) {
  const name = `${firstName || ''} ${lastName || ''}`.trim() || 'User';
  return `https://ui-avatars.com/api/?name=${encodeURIComponent(name)}&size=200&background=random&color=fff`;
}

// In populateProfile()
if (photoEl) {
  if (this.user.photoURL) {
    photoEl.src = this.user.photoURL;
  } else {
    photoEl.src = this.generateInitialsAvatar(this.user.firstName, this.user.lastName);
  }
}
```

**Why Optional:** Profile pictures aren't critical for a streaming platform. Google users already have photos, and email users can function without them.

## üîµ Low Priority / Future Considerations

### **3. Email Update Functionality**
**Status:** Disabled (Firebase restriction)  
**Effort:** Investigation required  

**Current State:**
Email updates are currently disabled because Firebase returns `auth/operation-not-allowed` error.

**Options:**
1. **Keep disabled** - Most platforms don't allow email changes without support
2. **Contact Firebase support** - Investigate if there's a specific setting needed
3. **Implement workaround** - Create support contact form for email change requests

**Decision:** Keep disabled for now. Users get clear message if they try to change email.

---

### **4. Add More Products**
**Status:** As needed  
**Reference:** `PRODUCT_MANAGEMENT_GUIDE.md`

**When Adding New Products:**
Follow the comprehensive guide in `PRODUCT_MANAGEMENT_GUIDE.md`:
1. Create product in Stripe
2. Update `src/backend/functions/src/stripe.ts`
3. Update `public/js/account-page.js` (for display)
4. Test purchase flow
5. Verify receipt generation
